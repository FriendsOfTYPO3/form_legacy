Adds the legacy form extension from TYPO3 CMS 7 LTS to TYPO3 CMS 8 LTS.

The functionality was part of TYPO3, until TYPO3 CMS 7 LTS, and moved into its
own extension, receiving its own public repository.

The new `Form extension`_ delivered with TYPO3 CMS 8 LTS substitutes this
extension and form_legacy is available to achieve backwards compatibility when
upgrading instances from core version 7 to 8.
