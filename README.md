# TYPO3 extension `form_legacy`

Adds the legacy form extension from TYPO3 CMS 7 LTS to TYPO3 CMS 8 LTS.

The functionality was part of TYPO3, until TYPO3 CMS 7 LTS, and moved into its
own extension, receiving its own public repository.

The new [Form extension](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/form) delivered
with TYPO3 CMS 8 LTS substitutes this extension and form_legacy is available to
achieve backwards compatibility when upgrading instances from core version 7 to
8.
